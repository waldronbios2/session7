# Review of S(t) and KM estimator

## Recall leukemia Example
* Study of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) maintenance therapy for children in remission from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
* 42 patients achieved remission from induction therapy and were then randomized in equal numbers to 6-MP or placebo.
* Survival time studied was from randomization until relapse.

## Leukemia follow-up table

![leukemia Follow-up Table](figures/leukemiatable.png)

This is the **Kaplan-Meier Estimate** $\hat S(t)$ of the Survival function $S(t)$.

## Leukemia Kaplan-Meier plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

leuk <- read_csv("leuk.csv")
leuk <- leuk %>%
  mutate(group = factor(group, levels = c("Placebo", "6 MP")))
kmfit <- survival::survfit(Surv(time, cens) ~ group, data = leuk)
survminer::ggsurvplot(kmfit, risk.table = TRUE, linetype=1:2)

# The Hazard Function

## The hazard function h(t)

* *Definition*: (review) The *survival function* at time t, denoted $S(t)$, is the probability of being event-free at t.  Equivalently, it is the probability that the survival time is greater than t.

* *Definition*: (review) The *cumulative event function* at time t, denoted $F(t)$, is the probability that the event has occurred by time t, or equivalently, the probability that the survival time is less than or equal to t. $F(t) = 1-S(t)$.

* *Definition*: The *hazard function* $h(t)$ is the short-term event rate for subjects who have not yet experienced an event.
    + $h(t)$ is the probability of an event in the time interval $[t, t+s]$ (s is small), given that the individual has survived up to time t
$$h(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} \frac{Pr(t \leq T < t+s | T \ge t)}{s}$$


## Leukemia dataset h(t) 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## KM plot
survminer::ggsurvplot(
  kmfit,
  lty.surv = 1:2,
  col.surv = 2:1,
  xlab = "Time (weeks)",
  ylab = "Survival Probability"
)
## hazard plot
library(muhaz)
haztreat = with(leuk[leuk$group == "6 MP",], muhaz(time, cens))
hazcontrol = with(leuk[leuk$group == "Placebo",], muhaz(time, cens))
plot(hazcontrol,
     lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Follow-up time (weeks)",
     xlim = c(0, 18))
lines(haztreat,
      lty = 2,
      lwd = 2,
      col = "red")

  "topright",
  legend = c("Control", "Treatment"),

  col = c("black", "red")
)
```

## The Hazard Ratio (HR)

* If we are comparing the hazards of a control and a treatment group, it could in general be a function of time:
    + $HR(t) = h_T(t) / h_C(t)$
* Interpretation: the risk of event for the treatment group compared to the control group, as a function of time

## The Proportional Hazards Assumption

* *Definition*: Under the *proportional hazards assumption*, the hazard ratio does not vary with time. That is, $HR(t) \equiv HR$.

* In other words, $HR$ does not vary with time
    + $HR(t)$ is a constant, $HR$, at *all times* t
    + this assumption is about the population, of course there will be sampling variation

## A nice proportional hazards dataset

![Vittinghoff Figure 6.3, p. 210](figures/vittinghofffig63.png)

## The hazard function h(t) (leukemia dataset)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## KM plot
ggsurvplot(
  kmfit,
  lty.surv = 1:2,
  col.surv = 2:1,
  xlab = "Time (weeks)",
  ylab = "Survival Probability"
)
## hazard plot
leuk %>% group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(haz = list(muhaz(time, cens)))

haztreat = with(leuk[leuk$group == "6 MP",], muhaz(time, cens))
hazcontrol = with(leuk[leuk$group == "Placebo",], muhaz(time, cens))
plot(hazcontrol,
     lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Follow-up time (weeks)",
     xlim = c(0, 18))
lines(haztreat,
      lty = 2,
      lwd = 2,
      col = "red")
legend(
  "topright",
  legend = c("Control", "Treatment"),
  lty = 1:2,
  lwd = 2,
  col = c("black", "red")
)
```

## Log-minus-log plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggsurvplot(
  kmfit,
  fun = "cloglog",
  risk.table = FALSE,
  linetype = 1:2,
  main = "log-minus-log plot for Leukemia dataset"
)
```

## Recall previous regression models

$$
E[y_i|x_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_p x_{pi}
$$

* $x_p$ are the predictors or independent variables
* $y$ is the outcome, response, or dependent variable
* $E[y|x]$ is the expected value of $y$ given $x$
* $\beta_p$ are the regression coefficients

For logistic regression:
$$
Logit(P(x_i)) = log \left( \frac{P(x_i)}{1-P(x_i)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_p x_{pi}
$$

For log-linear regression:
$$
log(E[y_i|x_i]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_p x_{pi}
$$

# Cox proportional hazards model

## Cox proportional hazards model

* Cox proportional hazards regression assesses relationship between a right-censored, time-to-event outcome and predictors:
    + categorical variables (e.g., treatment groups)
    + continuous variables
$$
log(HR(x_i)) = log \frac{h(t|x_i)}{h_0(t)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_p x_{pi}
$$
* $HR(x_i)$ is the hazard of patient $i$ relative to baseline
* $h(t|x_i)$ is the time-dependent hazard function $h(t)$ for patient $i$
* $h_0(t)$ is the *baseline hazard function*

Multiplicative or additive model?

## Interpretation of coefficients

* Coefficients $\beta$ for a categorical / binary predictor:
    + $\beta$ is the $log$ of the ratio of hazards for the comparison group relative to reference group ($log(HR)$)
* Coefficients $\beta$ for a continuous predictor:
    + $\beta$ is the $log$ of the ratio of hazards for someone having a one unit higher value of $x$ (1 year, 1mm Hg, etc)

* If the hazard ratio ($exp(\beta)$) is close to 1 then the predictor does not affect survival
* If the hazard ratio is less than 1 then the predictor is protective (associated with improved survival)
* If the hazard ratio is greater than 1 then the predictor is associated with increased risk (= decreased survival)


## Hypothesis testing and CIs

* Wald Test or Likelihood Ratio Test for coefficients
    + $H_0: \beta=0, H_a: \beta \neq 0$ 
    + equivalent to $H_0: HR=1, H_a: HR \neq 1$
* CIs typically obtained from Wald Test, reported for $HR$

## CoxPH regression for Leukemia dataset

\tiny
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
coxfit <- coxph(Surv(time, cens) ~ group, data = leuk)
summary(coxfit)
```

## Semi-parametric model

* Cox proportional hazards model is _semi-parametric_:
    + assumes proportional hazards (PH), but no assumption on $h_0(t)$
    + robust if PH assumption is not violated
    + time-dependent covariates may resolve apparent violations of the PH assumption.

# Parametric models

## What are "parametric" models?

* "Parametric" models estimate additional _parameters_ for the baseline hazard, e.g.:
    + **Weibull**: hazard function is a polynomial
    + **exponential**: hazard function is constant over time, survival function is exponential (special case of Weibull): e.g. healthy population with randomly occuring events
    + many other options for assumption of distributions
* Can be more powerful if assumption is correct
* Allows smooth estimation of baseline hazard, extrapolation
* Still a proportional hazards model
* Fit the same way but using `survival::survreg`

# Summary: proportional hazards assumption

* Constant hazard _ratio_ between groups over time (proportional hazards)
* A linear association between the natural log of the relative hazard and the predictors (log-linearity)
    + A multiplicative relationship between the predictors and the hazard
* Uninformative censoring
